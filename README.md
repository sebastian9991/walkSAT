# walkSAT

This code seeks to provide a stochastic algorithm to the boolean satisfiability problem, appropriately named WALKSAT. Showing the time complexity increase as both the number of conjunctions increase and the number of statements. 

## Rough explanation
runSAT.java outputs a graph showing the number of flips and terminations (That is, satisfied) as the C/N ratio increases. Where C is the number of conjunctions and N the number of statements, for which N $<=$ 10.
